# electric-field-simulator
A rudimentary program using VPython to create visual representations of electric fields at a point of observation due to one or more point charges. 
Created for my final project in Physics 2212 at Kennesaw State University.

Written and tested at www.glowscript.org, so I'm not sure how it runs locally.
